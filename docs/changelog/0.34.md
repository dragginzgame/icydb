## 0.34.0 - 2026-02-28 - Commit Narrative Consolidation and No-Shim Recovery

### 📝 Summary

0.34.0 starts the `0.34` clarity/consolidation track with a focused pass over commit execution internals, improving module responsibility narration and phase-level invariant readability while also removing compatibility shims in the commit recovery path.

### 🔧 Changed - Commit Module Narrative

- Added explicit module-boundary responsibility headers in `db::commit::{apply,prepare,replay}` to document semantic ownership and one-way layer dependencies.
- Added phase-level comments in long commit preparation/replay/apply paths to make ordering assumptions and fail-closed behavior explicit at the call-site level.
- Clarified mechanical-apply sequencing intent (`index -> row`) and deterministic replay/rebuild flow, reducing ambiguity for future structural consolidation work.
- Split prepared-op payload ownership into a dedicated `db::commit::prepared_op` module and kept `db::commit::apply` focused on mutation application behavior.
- Split recovery index-rebuild ownership into a dedicated `db::commit::rebuild` module and kept `db::commit::replay` focused on marker row-op replay.
- Extended the same boundary/phase comment pass through `db::commit::{store,memory,rollback}` and removed a one-call recovery marker-clear wrapper in favor of direct `with_commit_store(...).clear_infallible()` at the recovery boundary.

### 🔧 Changed - Compatibility Removal

- Removed the write-only recovery shim (`ensure_recovered_for_write`) and converged call sites on `ensure_recovered`.
- Removed commit-marker schema-fingerprint fallback behavior: replay now requires explicit fingerprint presence and exact match.

### 🔧 Changed - Data Module Narrative

- Added module-boundary responsibility headers across `db::data::{mod,entity_decode,key,row,storage_key,store}` to make ownership and one-way dependency flow explicit.
- Added phase comments to non-trivial key/row encode-decode paths (`DataKey`, `StorageKey`, entity decode helpers) and refreshed stale comment wording to match current control flow.
- Clarified `DataStore` boundary narration as a thin persistence wrapper that assumes prevalidated inputs from higher layers.

### 🔧 Changed - Index Module Narrative

- Added module-boundary responsibility headers across `db::index` and nested key/planning/predicate modules, including `index::key::{codec,ordered}` internals.
- Added phase-level comments in non-trivial index flows (raw key codec encode/decode, index-entry validation, range lowering, store range scan, and index mutation planning).
- Refreshed stale comments to match current control flow and tightened import placement in `index::store` by keeping module imports at top-of-file.
- Split raw-range scan/continuation resolution out of `db::index::store` into a dedicated `db::index::scan` module; `index::store` now owns persistence primitives only.
- Consolidated continuation-envelope helpers (`resume_bounds_from_refs`, `anchor_within_envelope`, `continuation_advanced`) under `db::index::envelope`, removing split authority across `range` and `envelope`.

### 🔧 Changed - Predicate Module Narrative

- Added module-boundary responsibility headers across `db::predicate::{mod,coercion,fingerprint,model,normalize,resolved,row_policy,runtime,schema,semantics}`.
- Added light phase commentary in key compile/evaluation boundaries (`normalize`, `runtime`, and semantic compare helpers) and refreshed stale wording for current control flow.
- Preserved behavior while clarifying ownership boundaries between normalization, validation, runtime execution, and comparison semantics.

### 🔧 Changed - Access Module Narrative

- Added module-boundary responsibility headers across `db::access::{mod,canonical,lowering,path,plan,validate}`.
- Added targeted phase comments for access-plan lowering boundaries and refreshed stale wording, including a small adapter comment typo cleanup.
- Kept access behavior unchanged while making planner/lowering/executor ownership boundaries explicit.
- Moved index-range "not indexable" reason scope/wording mapping into `db::access::lowering`; `db::index::range` now exposes only structural lowering reasons (`IndexRangeBoundEncodeError`).

### 🧭 Migration Notes

- Internal commit/recovery APIs are intentionally non-backward-compatible in this release (shim paths removed).
- Legacy commit markers without schema fingerprints are no longer replayable.
