Status tracking:
[docs/status/0.35-group-by-status.md](../status/0.35-group-by-status.md)

### 🔧 Changed

- Initialized the `0.35.x` detailed changelog track and linked it from the root changelog for active accumulation.
- Added grouped fluent-query entrypoints on load queries (`group_by`, grouped aggregate terminals, grouped hard-limit overrides, and grouped execution with continuation support) across core and facade session APIs.
- Added grouped fluent execution coverage for scalar-shape rejection and grouped continuation pagination behavior.
- Allowed grouped pagination planning without explicit `ORDER BY` by relying on canonical grouped-key ordering, while keeping scalar unordered-pagination rejection intact.
- Added explicit intent-level misuse errors for grouped query shapes on scalar fluent paths (`.page()` / `.execute()`), requiring `execute_grouped(...)` at the API boundary.
- Added grouped fluent id-extrema terminals (`group_min`, `group_max`) and covered declaration-order output semantics in grouped execution tests.
- Added explicit grouped fluent `group_min_by` / `group_max_by` deferral errors in grouped v1 so field-target extrema rejection is surfaced at intent construction time.
