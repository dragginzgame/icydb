# IcyDB 0.33.0

## Overview

0.33.0 advances GROUP BY integration by hardening planner-level separation between scalar and grouped intent, tightening grouped execution boundaries, and normalizing governance/audit contracts used to track architectural drift.

## Architectural Changes

- Introduced a strict logical-plan split where grouped intent is represented as a dedicated grouped variant rather than an optional scalar-plan extension.
- Removed the temporary grouped wrapper plan carrier and consolidated grouped metadata flow through the canonical access-planned query model.
- Normalized audit governance structure into recurring domain ownership (`planner`, `executor`, `cursor`, `access`, `storage`, `invariants`, `contracts`) plus crosscutting and oneoff tracks.
- Migrated historical audit material into the normalized audit hierarchy while preserving append-only history.

## Execution Changes

- Executor entry points now pattern-match scalar and grouped logical plans explicitly.
- Grouped logical plans are routed through an explicit grouped-not-enabled path instead of implicit scalar fallback behavior.
- Grouped handoff wiring and route-planning integration now consume grouped plan metadata directly from the canonical planned-query boundary.

## Validation & Invariants

- Group-query validation now validates grouped semantics against grouped logical-plan state instead of wrapper-only carriers.
- Planner and executor boundaries now enforce a stricter invariant: grouped semantics must remain type-level and must not be represented as transient scalar plan state.
- Audit governance now requires domain-owned recurring audits and day-grouped report retention to preserve invariant telemetry continuity.

## Error Model Changes

- Added grouped-plan-required validation signaling for paths that attempt grouped validation without grouped logical-plan state.
- Preserved explicit grouped unsupported execution rejection during gated runtime phases to avoid silent fallback semantics.

## Compatibility Notes

- This release changes internal planning and execution contracts around grouped intent; downstream integrations relying on internal plan carriers must align to the grouped logical-plan variant boundary.
- Grouped runtime execution remains intentionally gated; grouped plan construction and validation are activated ahead of runtime enablement.
- Audit and governance documentation paths are normalized; automation should use the new audit hierarchy and day-grouped reports convention.

## Test & Verification Matrix

- Expanded grouped route/planner contract coverage for grouped logical-plan transport and handoff consistency.
- Expanded grouped validation coverage around grouped-plan-required enforcement and grouped semantic rejection boundaries.
- Retained compile-fail and boundary tests that ensure grouped internals remain non-public and grouped runtime APIs stay gated until full enablement.
- Re-ran core crate tests to confirm grouped planning contract changes preserve scalar-path behavior while grouped runtime remains blocked.
