# 0.32.3 Status (as of 2026-02-27)

## 0.32.3 Scope

This status tracks grouped-readiness scaffolding from:

- `docs/design/0.32.3-group-by-readiness.md`

`0.32.3` is preparation-only and must not enable public grouped runtime behavior.

---

## In Scope (`0.32.3`)

- internal grouped handoff contract (query -> executor boundary)
- grouped error mapping scaffolding while grouped runtime remains gated
- expanded grouped determinism/ordering fixture coverage
- grouped observability schema lock-in (trace/metrics fields)
- grouped compatibility vectors for pre-enable wire-shape stability
- grouped disabled-path guardrails
- grouped ownership boundary clarification (query semantics vs executor runtime policy)

## Out of Scope (`0.32.3`)

- public grouped runtime execution enablement
- grouped cursor runtime semantics
- grouped public response/API surface (`execute_grouped`, grouped response variants)
- route/public taxonomy replacement

---

## Release Snapshot (`0.32.3`)

- [ ] `0.32.3` released
- [x] Internal grouped handoff contract added and wired through one boundary
- [x] Grouped error conversion scaffolding added and tested
- [x] Grouped determinism fixture matrix expanded
- [x] Grouped observability schema fields added and mapped
- [x] Grouped compatibility vectors/snapshots added
- [x] Grouped-disabled runtime guardrails expanded
- [x] Grouped ownership boundary notes/docs updated
- [x] Changelog entry added for `0.32.3`

Current `0.32.3` status: **in progress**.

---

## Exit Criteria (`0.32.3`)

`0.32.3` is complete when all are true:

1. grouped planning inputs flow through one internal handoff contract
2. grouped-domain error mappings are explicit and typed
3. grouped deterministic behavior is fixture-locked across insertion/hash permutations
4. grouped observability fields are defined and mapped at route/explain boundaries
5. grouped runtime remains disabled in public/scalar execution paths

---

## Verification Readout (Current)

Current verification run for this slice:

- `cargo test -p icydb-core route_plan_grouped_wrapper_lowers_ -- --nocapture` (pass)
- `cargo test -p icydb-core` (pass; includes unit + compile-fail coverage)

Environment note:

- `trybuild` compile-fail tests are stable under default `target/`.
- `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/icydb-target` intermittently fails in this environment with `Invalid cross-device link (os error 18)` and should be avoided for grouped-readiness verification.
