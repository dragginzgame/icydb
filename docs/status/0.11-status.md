# 0.11 Status (as of 2026-02-16)

## 0.11 Scope

This status tracks progress against `docs/design/0.11-range-pushdown.md` for
the `0.11.x` Secondary Range Pushdown work.

Data-integrity hardening has been deferred to a future milestone after 0.11
(see `docs/design/data-integrity-v1.md`).

---

## Release Snapshot

- [ ] `0.11.0` not started
- [ ] Range-pushdown implementation not started
- [ ] Range-pushdown parity/regression matrix not started

Overall status for 0.11 tracked work: **0% complete**.

## 0.11 Plan Alignment (Secondary Range Pushdown)

### 1. Planner Access-Path Extension

- Progress: **0%**
- Planned: secondary `AccessPath::KeyRange { start, end }` emission for valid
  range shapes.

### 2. Eligibility Matrix Extension

- Progress: **0%**
- Planned: prefix-equality + first non-equality range-component validation.

### 3. Bound Construction Correctness

- Progress: **0%**
- Planned: canonical lower/upper bound construction with inclusive/exclusive
  correctness and PK tie-break behavior.

### 4. Executor Traversal + Fallback Equivalence

- Progress: **0%**
- Planned: bounded index traversal with semantic parity against fallback path.

### 5. Pagination and Cursor Invariants

- Progress: **0%**
- Planned: preserve monotonic ordering, no-duplicate/no-skip paging, and
  continuation signature validation.

### 6. Required Test Matrix

- Progress: **0%**
- Planned: single-field ranges, composite prefix+range, BETWEEN, pagination
  under range, fallback parity, and edge-value coverage.

### 7. Explicit Non-Goals (Locked)

- No multi-index intersection
- No cost-based planning
- No OR-range decomposition
- No multi-interval pushdown

## Range-Pushdown Design Readout

- Design direction is solid and additive: it leverages 0.10 canonical ordering
  without changing storage or cursor format.
- Biggest correctness risk remains off-by-one boundary construction
  (inclusive/exclusive and composite prefix edges), which is already called out.
- Before implementation starts, lock exact operator-bound mapping
  (`>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `BETWEEN`) in one table-driven helper to avoid drift
  between planner and executor paths.

---

## Next Checkpoint

1. Add first implementation milestone entry once coding begins.
2. Start a table-driven parity suite skeleton for range-pushdown shapes.
3. Keep data-integrity milestones tracked separately as post-0.11 planning.
