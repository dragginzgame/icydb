The current trait model redundantly derives both EntityKind and FieldValues, even though EntityKind semantically requires FieldValues for all real entities. This works today but is brittle: the relationship is implicit, duplication is easy to get wrong in manual or test implementations, and future changes to either trait risk silent semantic drift or confusing compile errors. A future refactor should make the relationship structural rather than conventional—most likely by introducing a sealed, internal capability trait implemented by codegen and using a blanket impl to provide FieldValues automatically for valid entities. This would clarify boundaries between production entities and test stubs, reduce boilerplate, and allow trait constraints to evolve safely. The change is non-trivial and intentionally deferred until test infrastructure and trait stability are addressed together.
