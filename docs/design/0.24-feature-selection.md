# 0.24 - Feature Selection (TBD)

## 1) Context

`IndexRange` aggregate direct-path work is moved to patch scope (`0.23.6`):

- `docs/design/0.23.6-indexrange-aggregate-direct-path.md`

`0.24` should now target one clear feature with strong user impact, not patch-level hardening.

---

## 2) Explicit Deferral

Composite aggregate direct path is deferred from `0.24` planning commitment.

Reason:

- unclear performance upside versus canonical composite stream resolution
- high risk of duplicated composition logic and ordering drift

Any composite aggregate specialization must pass a dedicated complexity/benefit audit first.

---

## 3) Candidate Feature Tracks

Candidate A: Direction-aware index encoding (`DESC`-friendly traversal simplification)

- reduces special-case direction handling in index traversal
- high leverage for future range/pagination optimizations

Candidate B: Composite index key optimization (`EncodedValue`/raw-key boundary efficiency)

- lowers repeated key-materialization overhead
- improves planning/execution boundary clarity

Candidate C: Next aggregate capability (`sum` / `avg` with strict semantics gates)

- user-visible feature expansion
- requires clear numeric/overflow/consistency contracts

---

## 4) Selection Criteria

Pick exactly one primary `0.24` feature based on:

1. clear user-visible value
2. bounded architectural risk
3. reuse of existing canonical boundaries (no duplicated engines)
4. measurable verification strategy (parity + invariants + benchmarks where relevant)

---

## 5) Decision Output Required

Before implementation starts, record:

- selected feature and rationale
- explicit non-goals
- minimal acceptance matrix
- release boundary (`0.24.0`) and rollout phases
