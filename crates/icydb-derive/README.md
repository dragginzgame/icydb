# icydb-derive

Internal procedural macros used by the IcyDB workspace.

This crate provides derive macros used by runtime and tests, including:
- `FieldValues`
- `Display`
- `Inner`
- arithmetic derives such as `Add`, `Sub`, `Mul`, `Div`, and assign variants

This crate is part of IcyDB internals. Most users should depend on `icydb` instead.
