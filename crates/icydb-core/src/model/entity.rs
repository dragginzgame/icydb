//! Runtime-only entity schema surface generated by macros.
//!
//! This model intentionally includes only:
//! - entity metadata (path + stable external name)
//! - ordered fields
//! - primary key field
//! - index definitions
//!
//! It intentionally excludes:
//! - validators/sanitizers/defaults
//! - relations or full schema graphs
//! - JSON schema ingestion or global registries
//!
//! Stability: this is the authoritative runtime contract for planning and
//! execution. Additive changes are expected; breaking changes require a
//! coordinated version bump across the engine.
//!
//! Field names are entity-scoped. Callers that combine entities must
//! namespace by entity at the call site.
